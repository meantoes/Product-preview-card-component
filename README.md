# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I first figuring the layout for both mobile and desktop site. then I built the mobile site and used min-width for the desktop site.
I had struggle with how to change the image with media query, but then found the solution on youtube : use source srcset in picture.
also had struggle with the extra space caused by picture. solution : change image class' display into block hahahaahahhaahah.

### Tips

be patient ðŸ™‚. I did build some website before but still got some struggle on grid and flex.
Solution I found : check your old code and try to see the problem hhaahahahahahahaha.

### update
  
  I replace some of the code and used the feedback I received.
  I'm not sure about the width tho..
